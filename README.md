# Obsidian Strip Internal Links Plugin

This is a simple plugin to strip internal links from files and copies the result to the clipboard. That's it.

## Why though?

I often find myself wanting to send the contents of a file to someone. Maybe
some notes that I've made during a meeting, or just something I quickly jotted
down. I can't just send them my markdown with all my internal links, as those
don't make sense to them. So, I have to manually strip them out. This simple
plugin takes care of that.

## How do I use this?

Either:
1. In an editor, open the command palette and find the `Strip Internal Links: Entire file`
2. In an editor with text selected, open the command palette and find the `Strip Internal Links: Selection`

The result will be sent to your clipboard.

External links are preserved.
